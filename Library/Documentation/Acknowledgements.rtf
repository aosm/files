\f0\b \'a5 Common UNIX Printing System License Agreement 
\f1\b0 \

\f0\b INTRODUCTION 
\f1\b0 \
The Common UNIX Printing System
\fs18 \super TM
\fs24 \nosupersub  , (CUPS
\fs18 \super TM
\fs24 \nosupersub  ), is provided under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and GNU Library General Public License (LGPL), Version 2, with exceptions for Apple operating systems. A copy of the exceptions and licenses follow this introduction.  \
The GNU LGPL applies to the CUPS API library, located in the cups subdirectory of the CUPS source distribution and in the /usr/include/cups directory and libcups.a, libcups_s.a, libcups.sl, libcups.so, or libcups.dylib files in the binary distributions. \
The GNU GPL applies to the remainder of the CUPS distribution, including the pstoraster filter which is based upon GNU Ghostscript 5.50 and the pdftops filter which is based upon Xpdf 0.93a. \
For those not familiar with the GNU GPL, the license basically allows you to: \
   - Use the CUPS software at no charge. \
   - Distribute verbatim copies of the software in source or binary form. \
   - Sell verbatim copies of the software for a media fee, or sell support for the software. \
   - Distribute or sell printer drivers and filters that use CUPS so long as source code is made available under the GPL.\
What this license does not allow you to do is make changes or add features to CUPS and then sell a binary distribution without source code. You must provide source for any new drivers, changes, or additions to the software, and all code must be provided under the GPL or LGPL as appropriate. The only exceptions to this are the portions of the CUPS software covered by the Apple operating system license \
exceptions outlined later in this license agreement. \
The GNU LGPL relaxes the link-to restriction, allowing you to develop applications that use the CUPS API library under other licenses and/or conditions as appropriate for your application. \

\f0\b APPLE OPERATING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LICENSE EXCEPTION 
\f1\b0 \
In addition, as the copyright holder of CUPS, Easy Software Products grants the following special exception: \
Software that is developed by any person or entity for an Apple Operating System (Apple OS-Developed Software), including but not limited to Apple and third party printer drivers, filters, and backends for an Apple Operating System, that is linked to the CUPS imaging library or based on any sample filters or backends provided with CUPS shall not be considered to be a derivative work or collective work based on the CUPS program and is exempt from the mandatory source code release clauses of the GNU GPL. You may therefore distribute linked combinations of the CUPS imaging library with Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software. You may also use sample filters and backends provided with CUPS to develop Apple OS-Developed Software without releasing the source code of the Apple OS-Developed Software. \
An Apple Operating System means any operating system software developed and/or marketed by Apple Computer, Inc., including but not limited to all existing releases and versions of Apple's Darwin, Mac OS X, and Mac OS X Server products and all follow-on releases and future versions thereof. \
This exception is only available for Apple OS-Developed Software and does not apply to software that is distributed for use on other operating systems.  All CUPS software that falls under this license exception have the following text at the top of each source file:   This file is subject to the Apple OS-Developed Software exception.\

\f0\b TRADEMARKS

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. \
[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] \

\f0\b Preamble 
\f1\b0 \
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for your libraries, too. \
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. \
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. \
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.         Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. \
Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. \
 Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. \
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. \
The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. \
Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. \
However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free \
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. \
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a work based on the library and a work that uses the library.  The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library. \
Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. \

\f0\b GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE \
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\f1\b0  \
 
\f0\b 0.
\f1\b0  This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called this License).  Each licensee is addressed as you. \
A library means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. \
The Library, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms.  A work based on the Library means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a \
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term modification.) \
Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. \
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of \
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. \

\f0\b 1. 
\f1\b0 You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. \
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \

\f0\b 2. 
\f1\b0 You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and \
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: \

\f0\b a)
\f1\b0  The modified work must itself be a software library. \

\f0\b b) 
\f1\b0 You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.       
\f0\b c)
\f1\b0  You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \

\f0\b d)
\f1\b0  If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses     the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. \
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) \
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, \
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to \
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. \
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \

\f0\b 3. 
\f1\b0 You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices. \
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. \
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. \

\f0\b 4. 
\f1\b0 You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form \
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not \
compelled to copy the source along with the object code. \

\f0\b 5. 
\f1\b0 A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a work that uses the Library.  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and \
therefore falls outside the scope of this License. \
However, linking a work that uses the Library with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a work that uses the library.  The executable is therefore covered by this License. \
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. \
When a work that uses the Library uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. \
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline \
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative \
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) \
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. \
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. \

\f0\b 6. 
\f1\b0 As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a work that uses the Library with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit \
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. \
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things: \

\f0\b a) 
\f1\b0 Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable work that uses the Library, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) \

\f0\b b) 
\f1\b0 Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. \

\f0\b c) 
\f1\b0 If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. \

\f0\b d) 
\f1\b0 Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. \
For an executable, the required form of the work that uses the Library must include any data and utility programs needed for \
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally \
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. \

\f0\b 7.
\f1\b0  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library \
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: \

\f0\b a)
\f1\b0  Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library     facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. \

\f0\b b)
\f1\b0  Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. \

\f0\b 8.
\f1\b0  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any \
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your \
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \

\f0\b 9.
\f1\b0  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. \

\f0\b 10.
\f1\b0  Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. \

\f0\b 11.
\f1\b0  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. \
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any \
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. \

\f0\b 12.
\f1\b0  If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the \
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. \

\f0\b 13.
\f1\b0  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. \
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and any later version, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \

\f0\b 14.
\f1\b0  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \
NO WARRANTY \

\f0\b 15. 
\f1\b0 BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \

\f0\b 16. 
\f1\b0 IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING \
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \

Version 2, June 1991 \
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.  \
59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA\
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\

\f0\b Preamble
\f1\b0 \
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. \
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. \
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. \
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. \
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. \
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. \
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. \
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. \

\f0\b TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\f1\b0 \

\f0\b 0.
\f1\b0  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The Program, below, refers to any such program or work, and a work based on the Program means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term modification.) Each licensee is addressed as you. \
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. \

\f0\b 1.
\f1\b0  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. \
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. \

\f0\b 2.
\f1\b0  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:  \
 
\f0\b a)
\f1\b0  You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\
 
\f0\b b)
\f1\b0  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. \
 
\f0\b c)
\f1\b0  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) \
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. \
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. \
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \

\f0\b 3.
\f1\b0  You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: \
 
\f0\b a)
\f1\b0  Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \
 
\f0\b b)
\f1\b0  Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \
 
\f0\b c)
\f1\b0  Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) \
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. \
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. \

\f0\b 4.
\f1\b0  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \

\f0\b 5.
\f1\b0  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. \

\f0\b 6.
\f1\b0  Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. \

\f0\b 7.
\f1\b0  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. \
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. \
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. \

\f0\b 8.
\f1\b0  If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. \

\f0\b 9.
\f1\b0  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. \
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and any later version, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. \

\f0\b 10.
\f1\b0  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. \

\f0\b NO WARRANTY
\f1\b0 \

\f0\b 11.
\f1\b0  BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. \

\f0\b 12.
\f1\b0  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \

SQLite Copyright \
The original author of SQLite has dedicated the code to the public domain. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commerical or non-commerical, and by any means. \
Contributed Code
\f0\b \

\f1\b0 In order to keep SQLite complete free and unencumbered by copyright, other contributors to the SQLite code base are asked to likewise dedicate their contributions to the public domain. If you want to send a patch or enhancement for possible inclusion in the SQLite source tree, please accompany the patch with the following statement:\
 
\f3\i The author or authors of this code dedicate any and all copyright interest in this code to the public domain. We make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights this code under copyright law.\

\f1\i0 Regrettably, as of 2003 October 20, we will no longer be able to accept patches or changes to SQLite that are not accompanied by a statement such as the above. In addition, if you make changes or enhancements as an employee, then a simple statement such as the above is insufficient. You must also send by surface mail a copyright release signed by a company officer. A signed original of the copyright release should be mailed to: Hwaci, 6200 Maple Cove Lane, Charlotte, NC 28269, USA.\
A template copyright release is available in PDF or HTML. You can use this release to make future changes. If you have contributed changes or enhancements to SQLite in the past, and have not already done so, you are invited to complete and sign a copy of the template and mail it to the address above.\

Copyright \'a9 2002 Bram Moolernaar, et al.\
VIM LICENSE\
I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except that they must include this license text. You can also distribute unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must include this license text. You are also allowed to include executables that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\
examples and Vim scripts.\
II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim, including executables and/or source code, when the following four conditions are met:\
    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\
    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\
       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you must make your changes, including source code, available to the maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes. The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>.  If this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received your changes they will not have to be sent again.\
       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the text under a) applies to those changes.\
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from making their own changes to the official version of Vim.\
       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the changes if the following three conditions are met:\
	  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official version of Vim without fee or restriction.\
	  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them available to him.\
	  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This contact information must remain valid for at least three years after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long as possible.\
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes, you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version.\
    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the :version command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does not conflict with the license used for the changes.\
    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be removed or changed, except that the person himself can make corrections.\
III) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is <maintainer@vim.org>\
IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came with, at your option.\

Freely Available means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\
1.  You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\
2.  You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version. \
3.  You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when AND WHY you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\
\pard\tx340\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\li360\ql\qnatural
\cf0 a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\
b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\
c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide separate documentation for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 4.  You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\li360\ql\qnatural
\cf0 a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\
b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\
c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\
d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\ql\qnatural
\cf0 5.  You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. YOU MAY NOT CHARGE A FEE FOR THIS PACKAGE ITSELF.  However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that YOU DO NOT ADVERTISE this package as a product of your own.\
6.  The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.\

\f0\b\fs20 \cf0 BSD Protection License, February 2002
\f1\b0 \
Preamble\
--------\
The Berkeley Software Distribution ("BSD") license has proven very effective over the years at allowing for a wide spread of work throughout both commercial and non-commercial products.  For programmers whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is arguable that there is no better license than the BSD license, as it permits improvements to be used wherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint.\
This is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: The case of TCP/IP clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the rapid acceptance of standards -- often even being used instead of a de jure standard (eg, OSI network models).\
With the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the GNU General Public License, however, the continued success of this role is called into question.  Given that the inclusion of a few lines of "GPL-tainted" work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution -- and given that further work will likely build upon the "tainted" portions, making them difficult to remove at a future date -- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to protect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such "GPL-taint".\
In addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling (possibly closed-source) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a GPL-licensed competitor.  While under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license, if a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own (commercial) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non-closed distribution.\
For the above reasons, we put forth this "BSD Protection License": A license designed to retain the freedom granted by the BSD license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both non-commercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that freedom.\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow.\
BSD PROTECTION LICENSE\
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, AND MODIFICATION\
----------------------------------------------------------------\
0. Definitions.\
   a) "Program", below, refers to any program or work distributed under the terms of this license.\
   b) A "work based on the Program", below, refers to either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law.\
   c) "Modification", below, refers to the act of creating derivative works.\
   d) "You", below, refers to each licensee.\
1. Scope.\
   This license governs the copying, distribution, and modification of the Program.  Other activities are outside the scope of this license; The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program.\

   You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\
3. Modification and redistribution under closed license.\
   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute  the resulting derivative works, provided that you meet the\
   following conditions:\
   a) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such notices are normally distributed.\
   b) The derivative work must be clearly identified as such, in order that it may not be confused with the original work.\
   c) The license under which the derivative work is distributed must expressly prohibit the distribution of further derivative works.\
4. Modification and redistribution under open license.\
   You may modify your copy or copies of the Program, and distribute the resulting derivative works, provided that you meet the\
   following conditions:\
   a) The copyright notice and disclaimer on the Program must be reproduced and included in the source code, documentation, and/or other materials provided in a manner in which such notices are normally distributed.\
   b) You must clearly indicate the nature and date of any changes made to the Program.  The full details need not necessarily be included in the individual modified files, provided that each modified file is clearly marked as such and instructions are included on where the full details of the modifications may be found.\
   c) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\
5. Implied acceptance.\
   You may not copy or distribute the Program or any derivative works except as expressly provided under this license.  Consequently, any such action will be taken as implied acceptance of the terms of this license.\
6. NO WARRANTY.\

You should have received a copy of the Artistic License with this Kit, in the file named Artistic.  If not, I'll be glad to provide one.  You should also have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.\
For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License, my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.\
